# Ans1- strings-->1.used to represent sequence of charcters
# 2.specific type of Data
# 3.they are immutable

# variable-->1.its like a container for storing various data including strings
# 2.they are mutable


# Ans2- Three Diffrent types of data types are as follow

# -numeric data type --> which let us represent whole numbers
# eg--> int, float,etc


# -string-->it represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double qoutes

# -boolean-->represent the true value of an expression. it can have two possible values true or false

# Ans3-the bacon varible remains 22 as to change value of bacon 
# this expression is required bacon=bacon+1





# Ans4- 1. spamspamspam
# 2.spamspamspam

# Ans5-Because a valid varible name always start with a letter
    
# Ans6-this expression cuases an error beacuse you cant concatinate a integer with strings 

# --> to solve this we can put single or double qoutes around 99 then the expression would work

# Ans7-spam=int(input("enter any value="))

# if (spam==1):
#     print("hello")
# if (spam==2):
#     print("howdy")
# else:
#     print("Greetings!")




# Ans8-break statement brings you out of the loop as soon as the condition required comesss

# wheares continue statement only stop the ongoing iteration of the Loop


# Ans9-in range(10) the starting point is taken 0 by defualt so there is no diffrence between range(10)
# and range(0,10) wheareas in range(0,10,2 ) here 2 is the step the number of spaces between the sequence.

# Ans10-  1. for i in range(1,11):
#             print(i)


# 2.i=1
# while(i<=10):
#         print(i)

# Ans11-




# Ans12- it is data type of the class Nonetype

# Ans13- the purpose of try clause is that it puts all the code under code in check as soon as the program under try
# gives an error instead of stoping the program it directs towards whatever is written in except

# Ans 14- these are basically sqaure brackets ,they are used to define list data structures in python,they are also used for indexing etc

# Ans15-spam.insert(2,'hello')



# Ans16-1.value will be 'd'
# 2.value will be 'd'
# 3.a,b

# Ans 17-1. the index will be 1
# 2.the list will look like following[3.14,'cat'.11,'cat',true,99]
# 3.the list will look like followin[3.14,11,true,99]

# Ans18-in append whatever we add goes to the end of the list
# wheares in insert we can specify at which index we need to insert the element

# Ans19-two methods are remove()and pop().

# Ans20- diffrences are as follow
# 1.list are enclosed btw sqaure brackets[]
# tupes are enclosed btw round brakcts ()

# 2.list are mutable
# tuples are imutable

# Ans21- 


# Ans22-in copy.copy a copy of original object is stored and only refrence is copied
# wheares in deep copy in this orignal copies and repetative copies both are stored

# Ans23-empty dict={}

# Ans24-the most significant diffrence is in list we use sqaure brackets [],wheares in dict we use curly brackets {}

# # Ans25-we will get akey error as that key is not present in dict

# Ans26-
